# RGN2-Replica (WIP)

To eventually become an unofficial working Pytorch implementation of [RGN2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.02.454840v1), an state of the art model for MSA-less Protein Folding for particular use when no evolutionary homologs are available (ie. for protein design). 

## Install

```bash
$ pip install rgn2-replica
```

##Â Structure Prediction

### Installation
* Pytorch3D: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md

* **NOTES**: 
* Use functionality provided in [MP-NeRF](https://github.com/EleutherAI/mp_nerf) wherever possible (avoid repetition). 

## Language Model
### To load sample dataset

```
from datasets import load_from_disk
ds = load_from_disk("data/ur90_small")
print(ds['train'][0])
```
To convert to pandas for exploration
```
df = ds['train'].to_pandas()
df.sample(5)
```


### To train ProteinLM

Run the following command with default parameters

```bash
python -m scripts.lmtrainer
```
This will start the run using sample dataset in repo directory on CPU.
